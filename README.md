What is Haml? 

Haml is a markup language that describes HTML without using inline code. Haml is to Haiku as Rails is to Omakase. It is simple, clean, and relies on whitespace. 


  Var Haiku = function(Kyle's Voice){
   
    return ("In the cicada's cry
   
    There's no sign that can foretell
   
    How soon it must die.")
   
    };

  Var Omakase = function(Dramatic Reading Mark posted){
    
    return (" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E99FnoYqoII ")
  
  };

  Var Who is god = function(Holly's twisted mind){
    
    return (" https://thayer11.github.io/Project-1/ http://memoryholly.bitballoon.com/ ") 

};  

Haml is also a pain in the ass because it is VERY opinionated.  


Why is Haml useful?


Less characters

Less mess---no opening closing divs/inline stuff

Dom is visually represented

Easy to learn...I think


Why shouldn't we use Haml?


Because we are scared of change, devoted to HTML because it's what made us think coding might not be as hard as it is, our parents don't love us, and we are all going to die.
