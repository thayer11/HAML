What is Haml? 

Haml is a markup language that describes HTML without using inline code. Haml functions as a replacement for inline page templating systems such as PHP, ASP, and ERB. However, Haml avoids the need for explicitly coding HTML into the template, because it itself, is a description of the HTML with some code to generate dynamic content. Haml is to Haiku as Rails is to Omakase. It is simple, clean, and relies on whitespace. 


  Var Haiku = function(Kyles Voice){
  
   return ("In the cicadas cry
  
   Theres no sign that can foretell
  
   How soon it must die.")
  
  };

  
  Var Omakase = function(Dramatic Reading Mark posted){
    
    
    return (" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E99FnoYqoII ")
  
  
  };


  Var Who is god = function(Hollys twisted mind){
     
     
     return (" http://memoryholly.bitballoon.com/ ") 
  
  
  };
    

Haml is also a pain in the ass because it is VERY opinionated.  

Why is Haml useful?


Less characters

Less mess---no opening closing divs/inline stuff

Dom is visually represented

Easy to learn


Why shouldn't we use Haml?

Because we are scared of change, devoted to HTML because it's what made us think coding might not be as hard as it is, our parents don't love us, and we are all going to die. 

Oh and it isn't really easy to learn
